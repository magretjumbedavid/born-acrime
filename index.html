     <h2 class="book-name">The book name:patricia's and treveor's life</h2>
     <p1>
        Reason: The book has explained much more  on 
        how patricial passed through before and after 
        got pregnant for trevor.Onother explanation is 
        how she raised trevor regardless of being a single 
        mother.She was working hard in order to make 
        sure that her son is well safe and he has 
        everything he wants even his father was not 
        around. Her courage and masculinity made trevour 
        to develop in such behavior. For example at 
        some point trevor could was trying to have 
        something to do,so that he should not just 
        depend on her mom(he started sellings of CDs).

            The book is about Trevor and Patrical  Who were staying in the , in this case Trevor was a son 
            of Patricial . Trevor was born when there was apartheid. Trevor was a mixed child  since his 
            father was a white man and  Patricial was black woman but they did not marry each other so 
            Patricial raised Trevor as a single mother. The book was good. When I was  reading it I was 
            enjoying it because it has really encouraged me that I can do things that can be helpful to me 
            regardless of what the community believes in. I can see Patricial doing things she was able to 
            provide for her family yet her community believed that women's work is  to do all the household 
            work. Her behaviors allow Trevour to develop a hard working  life because at some point 
            Trevour was doing what his mother was doing, like working hard.

            <h2 class="abel">Abel's dream</h2>
            Now I have been encouraged after reading this book , that I can do what men can also do. I also 
            like the theme of masculinity and hardworking , this is so because these themes helped Patricial 
            in her life. And this made Abel not to fulfill his dream of marrying a subservient woman because 
            Patricial was working hence he did not manage to put her in a cage as he wished . After Abel 
            lost his job Patricial was providing family needs because of her hardworking spirit that seemed 
            like was a subservient woman to Abel.

            This book is similar  to my community  beliefs whereby people believe that a woman must do all 
            the household chores and then men should work to provide for the family. When the woman got 
            a job the villagers consider  her as a disrespectful person because she is doing things that 
            are opposite things with the villagers.
